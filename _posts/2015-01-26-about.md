<h4 style="text-align: left">Since I first encountered the BASIC programming language when I was studying in university, I have been deelply attracted to programming. Then I learned C++/C and Java by myself, and got my first job as a Java developer from Linkage Inc in 2006. Also, I am a big fan of Linux, I tried several different distributions of Linux during my college life, including Debian, Fedora, and Mandriva, to get familiar with the Linux environment, learning some basic bash script and python programming. BTW, my favorite editor is Vim.</h4>
